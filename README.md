Introduction :-
1) From 2006 Netflix start the analysing user data to predict how much a viewer would like a movie,  based on previous user Preferences.

2) Whenever we access the Netflix service, Netflix recommendations system strives to help us to find a show or movie to enjoy with minimal effort.

3) All of these done by  using user data as an inputs that we process in our algorithms.  ( An algorithm is a process or set of rules followed in a problem solving operation ) 

4) As well as we use clustering in this project. Clustering is a method of unsupervised learning and is a common technique for statistical data analysis used in many fields. 

Problem Statement :- 
1) This dataset consists of tv shows and movies available on Netflix as of 2019. The dataset is collected from Flixable which is a third-party Netflix search  engine.

2) In 2018, they released an interesting report which shows that the number of TV shows on Netflix has nearly tripled since 2010. The streaming serviceâ€™s  number of movies has decreased by more than 2,000 titles since 2010, while  its number of TV shows has nearly tripled. It will be interesting to explore what  all other insights can be obtained from the same dataset.

3) While using this Netflix Data we Try to Understand :- 
     i) Understanding what type content is available in different countries.
     ii) Is Netflix has increasingly focusing on TV rather than movies in recent years.
     iii) Clustering similar content by matching text-based features.
